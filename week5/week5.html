        <h2>WDD 330: Portfolio - Week 5</h2>
            <h3>Team Activity</h3>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Notes-Exercises</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings
                    <ul>
                        <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
                        <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
                        <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
                        <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. </li>
                        <li>Stack Trace: This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</li>
                        <li>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. </li>
                        <li>The strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. <br> 'use strict';
                        <br> You can use it inside a function. Modules are in strict mode by default.</li>
                        <li>Linting tools: They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented.</li>
                        <li>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.</li>
                        <li>The alert methods show a dialog and stop the program.<br>
                            console.log() <br>
                            console.trace()</li>
                        <li>Debugger: create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code.</li>
                        <li>Error objects: An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs.
                            <ul>
                                <li>EvalError: It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.</li>
                                <li>RangeError: is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
                                <li>ReferenceError: is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist.</li>
                                <li>SyntaxError: is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.</li>
                                <li>TypeError: is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used.</li>
                                <li>URIError: is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</li>
                                <li>InternalError: this is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Try, Catch, and finally: "Try" will run the code inside the block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto a catch block
                            A "finally" block can be added after a catch block. This will always be executed after the try or catch block.</li>
                        <li>Test-driven Development
                            <ol>
                                <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
                                <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                                <li>Refactor the code</li>
                                <li>Test refactored code</li>
                                <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
